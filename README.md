# Twitter Scraper Spanish - Word Cloud

I developed this code during the Ecuadorian general elections of 2021; the goal was to get a set of tweets about and specific trend (related to the candidates for the presidency) in a particular location (in this case, Ecuador). 

After wrangling and normalizing the collected data, it uses the spaCy library to remove Spanish stop words. Then it summarizes the information in a word cloud with the 1,000 most relevant or used terms. 

The code is available for all users; however, you should sign up for a developer account on Twitter and change the tokenizer according to the language you are interested in analyzing.
